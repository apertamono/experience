# My projects outside of Github

Since several repositories were moving to other services and not all of my work is open source, I'd like to list references to other websites showing my programming or code-related work. This would've been a gist if gists were properly visible. Check out my [training](https://github.com/ProkhorZ/training) repo for examples of my code. This isn't a complete summary of all my programming experience.

## Crypto

Like other early cryptocurrency enthusiasts, I got involved with development by mining, reading the code due to a lack of documentation, and finding a bug. But I might be the only one whose journey started with Gaycoin, which aimed to become the LGBT community's currency. Since I didn't have a Github account yet, I simply sent the developer an email. He confirmed my analysis and asked if I could do more, but I wasn't ready for that, while the coin wasn't getting any traction anyway.

[On the Monero project's self-hosted GitLab](https://repo.getmonero.org/ProkhorZ): in 2018-2019, I translated user guides to Dutch for the [Monero website](https://web.getmonero.org/). I also discussed issues and corrected a few errors.

[On GitLab](https://gitlab.com/ProkhorZ), for the Kovri project, which was meant to integrate I2P network privacy with Monero: in 2018-2019, I translated documentation and the Kovri website to Dutch. The translation was merged, but the Kovri project was cancelled after releasing an alpha version.

In 2021, I completed the [CryptoZombies](https://cryptozombies.io/en/course/) courses for beginners. This means I could program smart contracts on Ethereum and compatible blockchains in the Solidity language. But I doubt whether I'm qualified to program irreversible financial applications in a responsible way, given the frequent bugs and exploits in this area.

## Webdev

In 2019, I created [Blockchain Translator](http://blockchain-translator.com/), a profile website for myself as a freelancer, built in Bootstrap using [Start Bootstrap](https://startbootstrap.com/)'s Modern Business template. I like Bootstrap and I'm using it offline to create more websites - without using slides or making the user scroll endlessly.

In the past, I used PHP to personalize my Pivot blog, adding multiple blog channels as a workaround to create categories. Pivot was an open-source CMS written in PHP, developed mostly by my blog host Two Kings. I also used the include feature to insert boilerplate into various personal and professional websites, and having grown up in the era of information scarcity, I created a news portal page which displayed categories of links, quotes and images in random order.

## Boring stuff

As in Al Sweigart's [Automate the boring stuff with Python](https://automatetheboringstuff.com/), which was a lot of fun, actually. With the help of chapter 13 from this book, I used OpenPyXL to edit Excel files for my day job in translation, in 2020. I can't share the code here, because the data and data formats are confidential. I wrote a script to convert reports from workbooks with multiple worksheets into one row each in a database-style spreadsheet, adjusting the column width to the length of data fields. Separately, I wrote three scripts to organize data in spreadsheets: adding comments to duplicate entries, copying data for entries that matched entries in another file, and adding comments to entries found across multiple categories. This saved us hours of manual work, while producing more reliable results.

From August 1998 to March 2002, my day job was data processing in market research. My job title was application programmer. I prepared surveys for computer-assisted interviews and processed the data afterwards. I used the company's own proprietary script languages: one for marking up the survey text, one for displaying results and analyses, and one very concise Turing-complete script for correcting data.

For my MA thesis, finished in 1998, I computed statistics in SPSS. The fact that I enjoyed number crunching more than you'd expect from a literature student influenced my career choices.
